##### How it is done? How do I use it?
Check [Reverse Engineering](https://github.com/hiroshil/Setsuna/wiki/Reverse-Engineering) and [Usage](https://github.com/hiroshil/Setsuna/wiki/Usage).<br>

##### How can I download it? How do I build it?

Check [Releases](https://github.com/hiroshil/Setsuna/releases) and [Building](https://github.com/hiroshil/Setsuna/wiki/Building).

##### Multi-platform?

It's tested only on Windows 10, but can compile even in XP, probably.<br>
But can probably work on other systems with a bit of work!<br>
Also known as, rewrite the encode convertion functions that use the Windows API!<br>
